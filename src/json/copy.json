    "My work is grounded in a deep curiosity both in code and the synergistic effects of collaboration.",
    "When I was a kid that meant the perfect Magic card to both disrupt a schoolmates pesky Goblin deck AND throw another counter on my win condition. Now I find wonder and energy in working with a diversity of minds and skills intersecting to create meaningful, lasting web applications",
    "My path to web development was fairly unconvention, with my appetite for discovery driving each turn along the way. Curiosity has been the common underpinning throughout my work across theatre, anthropology, film, and insurance, which has allowed me to develop a strong set of cross disciplinary skills. Web development has been the natural culmination of my love for language, creative design, and understanding the human experience."
