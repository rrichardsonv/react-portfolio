    "Welcome!",
    "My work is grounded in a deep curiosity both in code and the synergistic effects of collaboration.",
    "When I was a kid that meant the perfect Magic card to both disrupt a schoolmates pesky Goblin deck AND throw another counter on my win condition. Now I find wonder and energy in working with a diversity of minds and skills intersecting to create meaningful, lasting web applications",
    "I've had a fairly unconventional path bring me to web development; however, as I look back I can see how each choice was made by the appetite of my curiosity. With deeper understanding at each step I recognized my own needs and the ways they did not allow me to express my strengths. I needed a vocation where I could hone my craft alone or with others, with like-skilled teams or cross-disciplinary collaboration, where new rules were written and the landscape was ever-changing.",
    "I've found that vocation and I'm excited for the challenges it offers."

    "Coming from the liberal and performing arts, I approach development through a creative lens with lateral problem-solving skills. I'm always challenging myself to consider how best to leverage my technical skills to create meaningful experiences for a given audience.",
    "At this stage in my career I am tenacious in my hunt for challenging and meaningful work, as well as a believer in craft as collaboration between the boundaries of client needs and my own skills and perspective.",
    "In my own time I experiment to fail upward striving to have the courage to, in the words of the great director and theorist Tadashi Suzuki, 'practice daily what you know is impossible'"
